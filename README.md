# SC2002-Hotel-App
## About 
This is an assignment for SC2002 (Object-Oriented Design & Programming) which is about applying Object-Oriented (OO) concepts to the development of the Hotel Reservation and Payment System (HRPS). It is used by hotel staff to **manage guests information**, **update room status**, **make reservations for guests**, **update room service menu items**, and **take room service orders from guests**.
\
\
The main object, [Hotel](src/hotelReservation/Hotel.java) holds the other 5 key objects which make up the full app. They are: 
1. **[Guest](src/hotelReservation/Guests.java)**
2. **[Room](src/hotelResevation/Rooms.java)**
3. **[Reservation](src/hotelReservation/Reservation.java)**
4. **[Menu](src/hotelReservation/Menu.java)** 
5. **[Room Service](src/hotelReservation/RoomServiceOrder.java)** 

We implements Model-View-Controller framework into our project. Each object consists of its class and a corresponding controller.
